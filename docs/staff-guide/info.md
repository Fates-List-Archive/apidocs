## Important Info

!!! warning

    Staff server is fully **PRIVATE**, inviting people to our staff server is not allowed and you will be demoted unless you ask 
    permission from me or a Admin/Head Admin before inviting. Additionally, moderation commands for bots should probably be discussed 
    in the staff server and then done in the main server. **In case you did not get an invite to it: ** [Invite](https://fateslist.xyz/servers/816130947274899487/invite)

    Test Server is fully **PUBLIC** meaning people can join it if they wish and you can/should invite them if there’s a issue reviewing the bot or whatever as it’s more helpful than a picture etc. **Public invite that can be used by anyone including staff: ** [Invite](https://fateslist.xyz/server/845928429357367316/invite)


**It is very importat to keep going back to this document every few days if there are ever any changes or otherwise as a refresher**

## Moderation Rules

Please don’t abuse the bots please **and only invite bots with permission from an Administrator+**

People higher in clearance *override* statements made by people lower (Head Admin word overrides Admin’s word) 
but **please feel free to privately report bad staff to an owner or via FL Kremlin/FL Secret Kremlin (if you have access to those)**

!!! note

    Wick is only for antinuke on the staff server. Use Minotaur (prefix of m/) for all normal moderation.
    This is why very few people (only Paul with EO and I have permissions)

    On main server, Minotaur and Wick can be used. Use Xenon as a backup bot

    On the test server, Minotaur is the only moderation bot as antinuke on a test server is dumb**

## Ashfur Bot Usage

Fates List uses Ashfur to handle bots (using slash commands)

/claim - Claims a bot, **be sure to unclaim it if you are not reviewing it anymore or else I might have to do another 3000 @everyone pings**

/unclaim - Unclaims a bot

/approve - Approves a bot. Be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and *most importantly* be formal.

/deny - Denies a bot. Once again, be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and *most importantly* be formal.

/requeue - Requeues a bot if it is denied. **This is moderator only**

**Update Discord if you don't see the commands and then DM a Administrator+ if you still cannot see it**

And... that's it! Yes, it's really that easy!

## Reviewing Bots

Our bot list rules and requirements can be found [here](https://fateslist.xyz/fates/rules). Please read through them before reviewing 
bots.

Whoever first adds the bot to this server can claim and check that bot. If you need to unclaim however, anyone may check it

Where possible, test at least 70-100% of all bot commands randomly (*it would be preferable to test all of them but this is time consuming 
and we want to deal with our queue as well...*).

**Remember, case-by-case basis means use your own judgement and ask other staff members if unsure**

Some things that should be checked for. Note that *all of the below is changeable on a case by case basis*:

- Admin Commands (antinuke is a special case and has an exemption here)
- Admin-locked bots (antinuke is a special case and has an examption here)
- NSFW commands with proper channel gating
- Does the bot follow Discord ToS?
- Is the bot offline? If so, take a screenshot of the bot being offline. Once you have taken a screenshot, 
post the media link in the reason for denial
- Quality of the bot. Does it provide *any* unique and interesting features? What is its use case? The staff verification
code is SHA1 of Frostpaw/[user id]. Is it a copy/fork of another bot?
- **Is the bot well-known and known to be high-quality?**
- **Is the bots owner correct (validate using other bot lists or Head Admins+ if needed), report violations to a Admin+ ASAP**
- **Quality of bot descriptions and long description**

**Remember. Approve and deny bots without bias. Just because you like/dislike the owner does NOT mean you approve/deny their bots!**


!!! info

    Head Admins+ may approve known large bots without fully testing them if they are KNOWN to be high quality and have been widely used 
    by them. This is in place to reduce our queue size allowing smaller bots to be tested more quickly and with better feedback


If a bot is in need of verification, it may also be tested on its support server. This also goes for regular bots as well.

## Bots in other languages

Do not deny bots for using other languages. These are officially supported. Instead, do one of the following:

- Use Google Translate: https://translate.google.com (**Note: only do this if there are no staff members only knowing said language as Google
Translate may miss context**
- Ask another staff reviewer for help
- Unclaim the bot and ping the Staff role asking someone to translate the bot (*the Staff role, not everyone*)

## Prefix Changes

Do not deny bots for not supporting custom prefixes. This is a suggestion. Instead mute the bot on the support server after approval and adding to the
main server.

**Same goes will any other suggestions in the rules**
