# Staff Info

**Some important information regarding Fates List**

!!! warning

    Staff server is fully **PRIVATE**, inviting people to our staff server is not allowed and you will be demoted unless you ask 
    permission from me or a Admin/Head Admin before inviting. Additionally, moderation commands for bots should probably be discussed 
    in the staff server and then done in the main server.

    Test Server is fully **PUBLIC** meaning people can join it if they wish and you can/should invite them if there’s a issue reviewing the bot or whatever as it’s more helpful than a picture


## Moderation Rules

Please don’t abuse the bots please **and only invite bots with permission from an Administrator+**

People higher in clearance *override* statements made by people lower (Head Admin word overrides Admin’s word) 
but **please feel free to privately report bad staff to an owner or via FL Kremlin/FL Secret Kremlin (if you have access to those)**

**Wick is only for antinuke on the staff server (down right now), use <@906732932918542366> (prefix of m/) for all normal moderation.
This is why very few people (only Paul with EO and I have permissions)**

    On main server, Minotaur and Wick can be used. Use Xenon as a backup bot

    On the test server, Minotaur is the only moderation bot as antinuke on a test server is dumb**
