## Important Info

!!! warning

    Staff server is fully **PRIVATE**, inviting people to our staff server is not allowed and you will be demoted unless you ask 
    permission from me or a Admin/Head Admin before inviting. Additionally, moderation commands for bots should probably be discussed 
    in the staff server and then done in the main server. **In case you did not get an invite to it: ** [Invite](https://fateslist.xyz/servers/816130947274899487/invite)

    Test Server is fully **PUBLIC** meaning people can join it if they wish and you can/should invite them if there’s a issue reviewing the bot or whatever as it’s more helpful than a picture etc. **Public invite that can be used by anyone including staff: ** [Invite](https://fateslist.xyz/server/845928429357367316/invite)


## Moderation Rules

Please don’t abuse the bots please **and only invite bots with permission from an Administrator+**

People higher in clearance *override* statements made by people lower (Head Admin word overrides Admin’s word) 
but **please feel free to privately report bad staff to an owner or via FL Kremlin/FL Secret Kremlin (if you have access to those)**

!!! note

    Wick is only for antinuke on the staff server. Use Minotaur (prefix of m/) for all normal moderation.
    This is why very few people (only Paul with EO and I have permissions)

    On main server, Minotaur and Wick can be used. Use Xenon as a backup bot

    On the test server, Minotaur is the only moderation bot as antinuke on a test server is dumb**

## Reviewing Bots

Fates List uses Ashfur to handle bots (using slash commands)

/claim - Claims a bot, **be sure to unclaim it if you are not reviewing it anymore or else I might have to do another 3000 @everyone pings**

/unclaim - Unclaims a bot

/approve - Approves a bot. Be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and *most importantly* be formal.

/deny - Denies a bot. Once again, be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and *most importantly* be formal.

/requeue - Requeues a bot if it is denied. **This is moderator only**

**Update Discord if you don't see the commands and then DM a Administrator+ if you still cannot see it**

And... that's it! Yes, it's really that easy!

## Bots in other languages

Do not deny bots for using other languages. These are officially supported. Instead, do one of the following:

- Use Google Translate: https://translate.google.com (**Note: only do this if there are no staff members only knowing said language as Google
Translate may miss context**
- Ask another staff reviewer for help
- Unclaim the bot and ping the Staff role asking someone to translate the bot (*the Staff role, not everyone*)
