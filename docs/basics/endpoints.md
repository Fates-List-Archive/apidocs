# Endpoints

Fates List does not provide a OpenAPI schema for API v3 however this is something that is being looked into!

## API v3 documentation

see [v3](../../api-v3)

???+ note

    Both https://api.fateslist.xyz and https://api.fateslist.xyz/api are acceptable base URLs for the API. As such both https://api.fateslist.xyz/docs/swagger and https://api.fateslist.xyz/api/docs/swagger are valid

**API v2 is deprecated. If you have any calls to https://legacy.fateslist.xyz**, please remove them as they will not go through!
