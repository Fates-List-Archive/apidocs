Make sure the location it is downloaded to is publicly accessible AKA not in a /root folder or anything like that. Download snowtuft using git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/Snowtuft . Make sure you have xkcdpass, python3.10 and docker compose ready. Make sure gcc-c++, libffi-devel, libxslt-devel, libxml2-devel, libpq-devel packages are installed. Run make install to install Snowtuft Enter Fates List directory, copy config_secrets_template.py to config_secrets.py and fill in the required information on there. You do not need to change site_url or mobile_site_url fields (site and mobile_site do need to be filled in without the https://).

A User, Bot, BotPartial (index and search page uses this) and ProfilePartial (profile search uses this) object both extend the BaseUser class. This is a basic structure that can be seen everywhere in the Fates List API. Note that all values here are according to our 8 hour redis cache we have setup to avoid being ratelimited. Key Description Type id The ID of the user Snowflake username The username of the user String avatar The avatar URL of the user String disc The discriminator String status The status of the user Status (see below) bot Whether the user is a bot or not Boolean Status Fates List also records the users status as well.
