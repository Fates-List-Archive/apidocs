You can get this from Bot Settings. Make sure to keep this safe and in a .gitignore/.env. A prefix of Bot before the bot token such as Bot abcdef is supported and can be used to avoid ambiguity but is not required. The default auth scheme if no prefix is given depends on the endpoint: Endpoints which have only one auth scheme will use that auth scheme while endpoints with multiple will always use Bot for backward compatibility Server: These endpoints require a server token which you can get using /get API Token in your server. Same warnings and information from the other authentication types apply here. A prefix of Server before the server token is supported and can be used to avoid ambiguity but is not required. User: These endpoints require a user token. You can get this from your profile under the User Token section. If you are using this for voting, make sure to allow users to opt out! A prefix of User before the user token such as User abcdef is supported and can be used to avoid ambiguity but is not required outside of endpoints that have both a user and a bot authentication option such as Get Votes. In such endpoints, the default will always be a bot auth unless you prefix the token with User Base Response A default API Response will be of the below format: { \"done\" : true , \"reason\" : \"Reason for success of failure, can be null\" , \"context\" : \"Any extra context\" } Core Index GET /index Returns the index for bots and servers API v2 analogue: (no longer working) Get Index Query parameters target_type [String? | default = bot (type info may be incomplete, see example)] Example { \"target_type\" : \"bot\" } Request Body {} Response Body { \"new\" : [ { \"guild_count\" : 0 , \"description\" : \"\" , \"banner\" : \"\" , \"nsfw\" : false , \"votes\" : 0 , \"state\" : 0 , \"user\" : { \"id\" : \"\" , \"username\" : \"\" , \"disc\" : \"\" , \"avatar\" : \"\" , \"bot\" : false } } ], \"top_voted\" : [ { \"guild_count\" : 0 , \"description\" : \"\" , \"banner\" : \"\" , \"nsfw\" : false , \"votes\" : 0 , \"state\" : 0 , \"user\" : { \"id\" : \"\" , \"username\" : \"\" , \"disc\" : \"\" , \"avatar\" : \"\" , \"bot\" : false } } ], \"certified\" : [ { \"guild_count\" : 0 , \"description\" : \"\" , \"banner\" : \"\" , \"nsfw\" : false , \"votes\" : 0 , \"state\" : 0 , \"user\" : { \"id\" : \"\" , \"username\" : \"\" , \"disc\" : \"\" , \"avatar\" : \"\" , \"bot\" : false } } ], \"tags\" : [ { \"name\" : \"\" , \"iconify_data\" : \"\" , \"id\" : \"\" , \"owner_guild\" : null } ], \"features\" : [ { \"id\" : \"\" , \"name\" : \"\" , \"viewed_as\" : \"\" , \"description\" : \"\" } ] } Authorization Needed | Resolve Vanity GET /code/{code} Resolves the vanity for a bot/server in the list API v2 analogue: (no longer working) Get Vanity Path parameters code [String (type info may be incomplete, see example)] Example { \"code\" : \"my-vanity\" } Request Body {} Response Body { \"target_type\" : \"bot | server\" , \"target_id\" : \"0000000000\" } Authorization Needed | Get Policies GET /policies Get policies (rules, privacy policy, terms of service) API v2 analogue: (no longer working) All Policies Request Body {} Response Body { \"rules\" : {}, \"privacy_policy\" : {} } Authorization Needed | Get Partners GET /partners Get policies (rules, privacy policy, terms of service) API v2 analogue: (no longer working) Get Partners Request Body {} Response Body { \"partners\" : [ { \"id\" : \"0\" , \"name\" : \"My development\" , \"owner\" : \"12345678901234567\" , \"image\" : \"\" , \"description\" : \"Some random description\" , \"links\" : { \"discord\" : \"https://discord.com/lmao\" , \"website\" : \"https://example.com\" } } ], \"icons\" : {} } Authorization Needed | Get Bot GET /bots/{id} Fetches bot information given a bot ID. If not found, 404 will be returned. This endpoint handles both bot IDs and client IDs Differences from API v2: Unlike API v2, this does not support compact or no_cache. Owner order is also guaranteed long_description/css is sanitized with ammonia by default, use long_description_raw if you want the unsanitized version All responses are cached for a short period of time. There is no way to opt out unlike API v2 Some fields have been renamed or removed (such as promos which may be readded at a later date) This API returns some empty fields such as webhook , webhook_secret , `api_token`` and more.

If not found, 404 will be returned. Differences from API v2: Unlike API v2, this does not support compact or no_cache. long_description/css is sanitized with ammonia by default, use long_description_raw if you want the unsanitized version All responses are cached for a short period of time. There is no way to opt out unlike API v2 Some fields have been renamed or removed invite_link is returned, however is always None unless Frostpaw-Invite header is set which then pushes you into server privacy restrictions Set the Frostpaw header if you are a custom client API v2 analogue: (no longer working) Fetch Server Path parameters id [i64 (type info may be incomplete, see example)] Example { \"id\" : 0 } Query parameters lang [Optional (type info may be incomplete, see example)] Example { \"lang\" : null } Request Body {} Response Body { \"user\" : { \"id\" : \"\" , \"username\" : \"\" , \"disc\" : \"\" , \"avatar\" : \"\" , \"bot\" : false }, \"description\" : \"\" , \"tags\" : [], \"long_description_type\" : 0 , \"long_description\" : \"\" , \"long_description_raw\" : \"\" , \"vanity\" : null , \"guild_count\" : 0 , \"invite_amount\" : 0 , \"invite_link\" : null , \"created_at\" : \"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\" , \"state\" : 0 , \"flags\" : [], \"css\" : \"\" , \"website\" : null , \"banner_card\" : null , \"banner_page\" : null , \"keep_banner_decor\" : false , \"nsfw\" : false , \"votes\" : 0 , \"total_votes\" : 0 } Authorization Needed | Get User Votes GET /users/{user_id}/bots/{bot_id}/votes Endpoint to check amount of votes a user has. votes | The amount of votes the bot has. voted | Whether or not the user has ever voted for the bot. vote_epoch | The redis TTL of the users vote lock. This is not time_to_vote which is the elapsed time the user has waited since their last vote. timestamps | A list of timestamps that the user has voted for the bot on that has been recorded. time_to_vote | The time the user has waited since they last voted. vote_right_now | Whether a user can vote right now. Currently equivalent to vote_epoch < 0 . Differences from API v2: Unlike API v2, this does not require authorization to use. This is to speed up responses and because the last thing people want to scrape are Fates List user votes anyways.

Other fields are empty arrays/vectors. This is used internally by sunbeam for the add bot system where a full bot index is too costly and making a new struct is unnecessary.

VPS Setup Download the Fates List repo on the VPS using git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/FatesList . Make sure the location it is downloaded to is publicly accessible AKA not in a /root folder or anything like that. Download snowtuft using git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/Snowtuft . Make sure you have xkcdpass, python3.10 and docker compose ready. Make sure gcc-c++, libffi-devel, libxslt-devel, libxml2-devel, libpq-devel packages are installed. Run make install to install Snowtuft Enter Fates List directory, copy config_secrets_template.py to config_secrets.py and fill in the required information on there. You do not need to change site_url or mobile_site_url fields (site and mobile_site do need to be filled in without the https://). If you have a packup, copy it to /backups/latest.bak, then run snowtuft dbs setup . Setup venv using snowtuft venv setup (you may need to run this multiple times to install all development dependencies Copy the nginx conf in info/nginx to /etc/nginx Restart nginx Run tmux new -s rabbit . Then run python3 rabbitmq_worker.py . This must be run before running Fates as this will create a queue on RabbitMQ. Run bin/run in the repo folder Follow this to set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. Set Grafanas port to 5050. Use a firewall or the digital ocean firewall to block other ports. Do not open prometheus's port in the firewall, only open Grafana's.

The /api will always point to latest API version thanks to our versioning middleware and this version may change often . To avoid breaking changes, just pin the version you are using. Note that the endpoint docs use the Direct Pinning, while you typically want and we recommend Header Pinning. Pinning does not apply to documentation. Header Pinning The first way to pin the version is by using the \u2019FL-API-Version\u2019 header. Just set this header to the API version you are using (just the number, not the v part). Direct Pinning Another very common way to pin the API versiom is to directly access the needed version using /api/vVERSION/endpoint like in the endpoint docs instead of /api. This is the most common form of pinning. Middleware Information (for those curious) The /api route actually handled by a ASGI middleware which sees the API request, checks for version pinning and whether it\u2019s a API request or a docs request and then edits the ASGI scope (I know, this is hacky but the easiest and probably the only way) accordingly to handle the API with the default API version internally pinned if not explicitly overrided otherwise.

If you do not have a linux machine or if you do not understand the above, just say so in the PR and allow edits from others so we can build the new site docs for you How to apply See our staff application to apply for staff on Fates List. Staff should also redirect users here Important Info It is very importat to keep going back to this document every few days if there are ever any changes or otherwise as a refresher Flamepaw is our staff and testing server. Invite Moderation Rules Please don\u2019t abuse our bots please. People higher in clearance override statements made by people lower (Head Admin word overrides Admin\u2019s word) but please feel free to privately report bad staff to an owner or via FL Kremlin/FL Secret Kremlin (if you have access to those) Never bash or complain about things in the Testing Channels. We have staff-chat for a very good reason If it's highly confidential, consider using DMs or asking for a Group DM. Staff chat is visible to bots with the Administrator permission Note On main server, Minotaur and Wick can be used. Use Xenon as a backup bot On Flamepaw, Minotaur is the only moderation bot as antinuke on a test server is dumb** Ashfur Bot Usage Fates List uses Ashfur to handle bots (using slash commands) /claim - Claims a bot, be sure to unclaim it if you are not reviewing it anymore or else I might have to do another 3000 @everyone pings /unclaim - Unclaims a bot /approve - Approves a bot. Be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and most importantly be formal. /deny - Denies a bot. Once again, be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and most importantly be formal. /requeue - Requeues a bot if it is denied. This is moderator only Update Discord if you don't see the commands and then DM a Administrator+ if you still cannot see it And... that's it! Yes, it's really that easy! Reviewing Bots Our bot list rules and requirements can be found here . Please read through them before reviewing bots. Whoever first adds the bot to this server can claim and check that bot. If you need to unclaim however, anyone may check it Where possible, test at least 70-100% of all bot commands randomly ( it would be preferable to test all of them but this is time consuming and we want to deal with our queue as well... ). Remember, case-by-case basis means use your own judgement and ask other staff members if unsure Some things that should be checked for. Note that all of the below is changeable on a case by case basis : Admin Commands (antinuke is a special case and has an exemption here) Admin-locked bots (antinuke is a special case and has an examption here) NSFW commands with proper channel gating Does the bot follow Discord ToS? Is the bot offline? If so, take a screenshot of the bot being offline. Once you have taken a screenshot, post the media link in the reason for denial Quality of the bot. Does it provide any unique and interesting features? What is its use case? The staff verification code is not SHA1 of Frostpaw/[user id]. Is it a copy/fork of another bot? Is the bot well-known and known to be high-quality? Is the bots owner correct (validate using other bot lists or Head Admins+ if needed), report violations to a Admin+ ASAP Quality of bot descriptions and long description Remember. Approve and deny bots without bias. Just because you like/dislike the owner does NOT mean you approve/deny their bots! Info Head Admins+ may approve known large bots without fully testing them if they are KNOWN to be high quality and have been widely used by them. This is in place to reduce our queue size allowing smaller bots to be tested more quickly and with better feedback If a bot is in need of verification, it may also be tested on its support server. This also goes for regular bots as well. Bots in other languages Do not deny bots for using other languages. These are officially supported.

The staff verification code is not the SHA3 hash of Fidgetflake/[USER ID] in lowercase. Unclaim the bot and ping the Staff role asking someone to translate the bot ( the Staff role, not everyone ) Prefix Changes Do not deny bots for not supporting custom prefixes. This is a suggestion. Instead mute the bot on the support server after approval and adding to the main server. Same goes with any other suggestions in the rules Partnerships All partnerships are to be decided by FL Kremlin or Overseers. If you are not in FL Kremlin, DM any partnership requests to a Head Admin+. The same goes with staff applications Getting Help Feel DM any staff member if you need help with something. We are here to help you. Don't be rude and always strive to be respectful. Ban Appeals We use our Ban Appeals Server to handle Ban Appeals. This approach was chosen to ensure that ban appeals are personalised for users. Not everyone that gets banned may want to appeal (some just want the ban reason) and not everyone that gets banned falls into the same category as someone else. As staff, you are expected to deal with ban appeals and turn to a higher up when required. Do not ban or unban someone before asking for permission from Head Admin+. Warn or kick instead Review Process Quick Start Run /claim to claim the bot. Be sure to unclaim it with /unclaim if you are not reviewing it anymore Test the bot as per Reviewing Bots Use /approve and /deny accordingly Lynx Once you get accepted into FL Kremlin and have a role of Admin/Head Admin+, you can request access to Lynx Lynx is our admin panel giving you complete control of the database. Access is granted manually and will be monitored. You will be removed for abuse. The verification code is the SHA3-224 of Shadowsight/BristleXRoot/[USER ID] Lynx can/is slightly buggy at times. Report these bugs to Rootspring#6701 please. Some ground rules with Lynx: Do not use Lynx for normal moderation/bot review. Use the admin bot instead Use Lynx as little as possible.

Do not change enums/delete rows you think are erroneous, it probably is intentionally like that Do not, absolutely do not share login credentials or access to Lynx with others without the explicit permission of Rootspring#6701 .

Please read through them before reviewing bots. Whoever first adds the bot to this server can claim and check that bot. If you need to unclaim however, anyone may check it Where possible, test at least 70-100% of all bot commands randomly ( it would be preferable to test all of them but this is time consuming and we want to deal with our queue as well... ). Remember, case-by-case basis means use your own judgement and ask other staff members if unsure Some things that should be checked for. Note that all of the below is changeable on a case by case basis : Admin Commands (antinuke is a special case and has an exemption here) Admin-locked bots (antinuke is a special case and has an examption here) NSFW commands with proper channel gating Does the bot follow Discord ToS? Is the bot offline? If so, take a screenshot of the bot being offline. Once you have taken a screenshot, post the media link in the reason for denial Quality of the bot. Does it provide any unique and interesting features? What is its use case? The staff verification code is not SHA1 of Frostpaw/[user id]. Is it a copy/fork of another bot? Is the bot well-known and known to be high-quality? Is the bots owner correct (validate using other bot lists or Head Admins+ if needed), report violations to a Admin+ ASAP Quality of bot descriptions and long description Remember. Approve and deny bots without bias. Just because you like/dislike the owner does NOT mean you approve/deny their bots! Info Head Admins+ may approve known large bots without fully testing them if they are KNOWN to be high quality and have been widely used by them. This is in place to reduce our queue size allowing smaller bots to be tested more quickly and with better feedback If a bot is in need of verification, it may also be tested on its support server.

Please read this nice MDN doc on WebSockets first before attempting this from scratch. We have example libraries below in case you just want to get it done quickly! Receiving Responses Large responses are seperated using ASCII Code 31 This is \\x1f in python. Some example code on how to recieve responses from websocket is below: for m in event . split ( \" \\x1f \" ): for e in m . split ( \" \\x1f \" ): if e == \"\" : continue e_json = json . loads ( e ) if e_json . get ( \"m\" ): e_type = e_json [ \"m\" ] . get ( \"e\" ) ... elif e_json . get ( \"control\" ): ... await self . hooks [ \"default\" ]( e_json ) Payloads Payloads sent by the websocket server are either events or control payloads. The format for sending data from the client to the websocket is still being worked on and is not used in any case. Below is the format for a control payload: Key Description Type chan The redis channel of the object String? code The control payload name. This can be used to check for an identity etc. String detail Human friendly information describing the control payload for debugging. May be used in future for non-debugging purposes String ts The timestamp in seconds for the event Integer/Float requests_remaining The amount of requests remaining before you are ratelimited.

This may cause disconnects/instability, more memory usage and ratelimits on large bots Boolean send_none Whether or not to send events after sending prior events if send_all is set Boolean bot Set this to true for a bot, otherwise this will default to a guild Boolean After a successful identity, you will now have a established websocket connection.
