Make sure the location it is downloaded to is publicly accessible AKA not in a /root folder or anything like that. Download snowtuft using git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/Snowtuft . Make sure you have xkcdpass, python3.10 and docker compose ready. Make sure gcc-c++, libffi-devel, libxslt-devel, libxml2-devel, libpq-devel packages are installed. Run make install to install Snowtuft Enter Fates List directory, copy config_secrets_template.py to config_secrets.py and fill in the required information on there. You do not need to change site_url or mobile_site_url fields (site and mobile_site do need to be filled in without the https://).

The /api will always point to latest API version thanks to our versioning middleware and this version may change often . To avoid breaking changes, just pin the version you are using. Note that the endpoint docs use the Direct Pinning, while you typically want and we recommend Header Pinning. Pinning does not apply to documentation. Header Pinning The first way to pin the version is by using the \u2019FL-API-Version\u2019 header. Just set this header to the API version you are using (just the number, not the v part). Direct Pinning Another very common way to pin the API versiom is to directly access the needed version using /api/vVERSION/endpoint like in the endpoint docs instead of /api. This is the most common form of pinning. Middleware Information (for those curious) The /api route actually handled by a ASGI middleware which sees the API request, checks for version pinning and whether it\u2019s a API request or a docs request and then edits the ASGI scope (I know, this is hacky but the easiest and probably the only way) accordingly to handle the API with the default API version internally pinned if not explicitly overrided otherwise.

If you want more events like review creation and review voting, edit bot and other such events, you will need to switch to the FatesHook webhook type (see FatesHook ) but in most cases, this is not required. It is also harder to handle FatesHook events compared to this and you are better off using websockets (documentation coming soon) if u need those real time stats. Key Description Type id This is the ID of the user who voted for your bot Snowflake votes This is how many votes your bot now has Integer test This key is only returned if you are testing your webhook. It will always be true if sent. Use this to check for test webhook or not. Boolean? mode This tells you the mode and allows you to quickly check between \u201dFC\u201d (FatesHook) or \u201dVOTE\u201d (Vote Webhook). Ignore it if you are not a library String payload This will always be \u201devent\u201d in Vote Webhook. Ignore it. It\u2019s a implementation detail that bots now rely on seeing for some reason.
