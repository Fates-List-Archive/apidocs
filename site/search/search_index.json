Make sure the location it is downloaded to is publicly accessible AKA not in a /root folder or anything like that. Download snowtuft using git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/Snowtuft . Make sure you have xkcdpass, python3.10 and docker compose ready. Make sure gcc-c++, libffi-devel, libxslt-devel, libxml2-devel, libpq-devel packages are installed. Run make install to install Snowtuft Enter Fates List directory, copy config_secrets_template.py to config_secrets.py and fill in the required information on there. You do not need to change site_url or mobile_site_url fields (site and mobile_site do need to be filled in without the https://).

The /api will always point to latest API version thanks to our versioning middleware and this version may change often . To avoid breaking changes, just pin the version you are using. Note that the endpoint docs use the Direct Pinning, while you typically want and we recommend Header Pinning. Pinning does not apply to documentation. Header Pinning The first way to pin the version is by using the \u2019FL-API-Version\u2019 header. Just set this header to the API version you are using (just the number, not the v part). Direct Pinning Another very common way to pin the API versiom is to directly access the needed version using /api/vVERSION/endpoint like in the endpoint docs instead of /api. This is the most common form of pinning. Middleware Information (for those curious) The /api route actually handled by a ASGI middleware which sees the API request, checks for version pinning and whether it\u2019s a API request or a docs request and then edits the ASGI scope (I know, this is hacky but the easiest and probably the only way) accordingly to handle the API with the default API version internally pinned if not explicitly overrided otherwise.

Please read this nice MDN doc on WebSockets first before attempting this. Check if your library supports the new v2 websocket rewrite first or use one of the example reference libraries here . Receiving Responses Large responses are seperated using ASCII Code 31 This is \\x1f in python. Some example code on how to recieve responses from websocket is below: for m in event . split ( \" \\x1f \" ): for e in m . split ( \" \\x1f \" ): if e == \"\" : continue e_json = json . loads ( e ) if e_json . get ( \"m\" ): e_type = e_json [ \"m\" ] . get ( \"e\" ) ... elif e_json . get ( \"control\" ): ... await self . hooks [ \"default\" ]( e_json ) Payloads Payloads sent by the websocket server are either events or control payloads. The format for sending data from the client to the websocket is still being worked on and is not yet implemented in any case. Below is the format for a control payload: Key Description Type code The control payload name. This can be used to check for an identity etc. String detail Human friendly information describing the control payload for debugging.
