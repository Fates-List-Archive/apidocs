Make sure the location it is downloaded to is publicly accessible AKA not in a /root folder or anything like that. Download snowtuft using git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/Snowtuft . Make sure you have xkcdpass, python3.10 and docker compose ready. Make sure gcc-c++, libffi-devel, libxslt-devel, libxml2-devel, libpq-devel packages are installed. Run make install to install Snowtuft Enter Fates List directory, copy config_secrets_template.py to config_secrets.py and fill in the required information on there. You do not need to change site_url or mobile_site_url fields (site and mobile_site do need to be filled in without the https://).

The /api will always point to latest API version thanks to our versioning middleware and this version may change often . To avoid breaking changes, just pin the version you are using. Note that the endpoint docs use the Direct Pinning, while you typically want and we recommend Header Pinning. Pinning does not apply to documentation. Header Pinning The first way to pin the version is by using the \u2019FL-API-Version\u2019 header. Just set this header to the API version you are using (just the number, not the v part). Direct Pinning Another very common way to pin the API versiom is to directly access the needed version using /api/vVERSION/endpoint like in the endpoint docs instead of /api. This is the most common form of pinning. Middleware Information (for those curious) The /api route actually handled by a ASGI middleware which sees the API request, checks for version pinning and whether it\u2019s a API request or a docs request and then edits the ASGI scope (I know, this is hacky but the easiest and probably the only way) accordingly to handle the API with the default API version internally pinned if not explicitly overrided otherwise.

Additionally, moderation commands for bots should probably be discussed in the staff server and then done in the main server. In case you did not get an invite to it: Invite Test Server is fully PUBLIC meaning people can join it if they wish and you can/should invite them if there\u2019s a issue reviewing the bot or whatever as it\u2019s more helpful than a picture etc. Public invite that can be used by anyone including staff: Invite It is very importat to keep going back to this document every few days if there are ever any changes or otherwise as a refresher Moderation Rules Please don\u2019t abuse the bots please and only invite bots with permission from an Administrator+ People higher in clearance override statements made by people lower (Head Admin word overrides Admin\u2019s word) but please feel free to privately report bad staff to an owner or via FL Kremlin/FL Secret Kremlin (if you have access to those) Note Wick is only for antinuke on the staff server. Use Minotaur (prefix of m/) for all normal moderation. This is why very few people (only Paul with EO and I have permissions) On main server, Minotaur and Wick can be used. Use Xenon as a backup bot On the test server, Minotaur is the only moderation bot as antinuke on a test server is dumb** Ashfur Bot Usage Fates List uses Ashfur to handle bots (using slash commands) /claim - Claims a bot, be sure to unclaim it if you are not reviewing it anymore or else I might have to do another 3000 @everyone pings /unclaim - Unclaims a bot /approve - Approves a bot. Be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and most importantly be formal. /deny - Denies a bot. Once again, be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and most importantly be formal. /requeue - Requeues a bot if it is denied. This is moderator only Update Discord if you don't see the commands and then DM a Administrator+ if you still cannot see it And... that's it! Yes, it's really that easy! Reviewing Bots Our bot list rules and requirements can be found here . Please read through them before reviewing bots. Where possible, test at least 70-100% of all bot commands randomly ( it would be preferable to test all of them but this is time consuming and we want to deal with our queue as well... ). Remember, case-by-case basis means use your own judgement and ask other staff members if unsure Some things that should be checked for. Note that all of the below is changeable on a case by case basis : Admin Commands (antinuke is a special case and has an exemption here) Admin-locked bots (antinuke is a special case and has an examption here) NSFW commands with proper channel gating Does the bot follow Discord ToS? Quality of the bot. Does it provide unique and interesting features? What is its use case? Is the bots owner correct (validate using other bot lists or Head Admins+ if needed), report violations to a Admin+ ASAP Quality of bot descriptions and long description Remember. Approve and deny bots without bias. Just because you like/dislike the owner does NOT mean you approve/deny their bots! Info Head Admins+ may approve known large bots without fully testing them if they are KNOWN to be high quality and have been widely used by them. This is in place to reduce our queue size allowing smaller bots to be tested more quickly and with better feedback If a bot is in need of verification, it may also be tested on its support server. This also goes for regular bots as well. Bots in other languages Do not deny bots for using other languages. These are officially supported. Instead, do one of the following: Use Google Translate: https://translate.google.com ( Note: only do this if there are no staff members only knowing said language as Google Translate may miss context Ask another staff reviewer for help Unclaim the bot and ping the Staff role asking someone to translate the bot ( the Staff role, not everyone ) Prefix Changes Do not deny bots for not supporting custom prefixes.
