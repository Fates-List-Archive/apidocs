Make sure the location it is downloaded to is publicly accessible AKA not in a /root folder or anything like that. Download snowtuft using git clone https://github.com/Fates-List/Snowtuft . Make sure you have xkcdpass, python3.10 and docker compose ready. Make sure gcc-c++, libffi-devel, libxslt-devel, libxml2-devel, libpq-devel packages are installed. Run make install to install Snowtuft Enter Fates List directory, copy config_secrets_template.py to config_secrets.py and fill in the required information on there. You do not need to change site_url or mobile_site_url fields (site and mobile_site do need to be filled in without the https://).

Note that the endpoint docs use the Direct Pinning, while you typically want and we recommend Header Pinning. Pinning does not apply to documentation. Header Pinning The first way to pin the version is by using the \u2019FL-API-Version\u2019 header. Just set this header to the API version you are using (just the number, not the v part).

A User, Bot, BotPartial (index and search page uses this) and ProfilePartial (profile search uses this) object both extend the BaseUser class.
