Some features require whitelisting in order to use (DM a Fates List staff member for this): Frostpaw Auth Note This feature requires whitelisting in order to use In order to authorize to the API through OAuth (without using a inputted user token, you need to use Frostpaw Authentication) Getting the login link The first step in Frostpaw Auth is getting the login link: To do this: Store the current location if needed (use localStorage if needed) Send a POST request to https://fateslist.xyz/api/v2/oauth . Make sure to send the Frostpaw header (set this to the client version in the About section) Set the Frostpaw-Server header to the origin servers hostname , for example https://fateslist.xyz/bot/admin/add would set Frostpaw-Server as https://fateslist.xyz. You can use window.location.origin for this if this is for a browser The final redirect requires explicit whitelisting, possible source code access and a possible POC to be shown JSON body should contain the scopes key (which should just be a array containing just identify ). redirect is deprecated The final url to redirect to will be in the url key of the response We will guide you on the redirect_uri side. There is a very specific route you will need to give (official sunbeam client uses /frostpaw/login and as such your client will also need to expose a /frostpaw/login route as well) Relevant API Docs Get login information This step is domain-dependent, you might need another server to set the required cookies and/or parse JWTs. We do not recommend using /jwtparse/_sunbeam or our Set-Cookie headers without asking us beforehand as these may or may not work in the future and may need extra whitelisting in the future The general idea is the below: Get the code and state from query string ( new URLSearchParams(window.location.search) if you are on browser) Send a POST request to https://api.fateslist.xyz/api/v2/users Make sure to send the Frostpaw header (set this to the client version in the About section) Set the Frostpaw-Server header to the origin servers hostname , for example https://fateslist.xyz/bot/admin/add would set Frostpaw-Server as https://fateslist.xyz. You can use window.location.origin for this if this is for a browser Be sure to set code to the code you got from query string and scopes which should be a array containing just identify Handle errors from our API properly (ask staff if you need a test account banned etc.).

We have staff-chat for a very good reason If it's highly confidential, consider using DMs or asking for a Group DM. Staff chat is visible to bots with the Administrator permission Note On main server, Minotaur and Wick can be used. Use Xenon as a backup bot On Flamepaw, Minotaur is the only moderation bot as antinuke on a test server is dumb** Ashfur Bot Usage Fates List uses Ashfur to handle bots (using slash commands) /claim - Claims a bot, be sure to unclaim it if you are not reviewing it anymore or else I might have to do another 3000 @everyone pings /unclaim - Unclaims a bot /approve - Approves a bot. Be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and most importantly be formal. /deny - Denies a bot. Once again, be sure to give good appropriate feedback and be polite and most importantly be formal. /requeue - Requeues a bot if it is denied. This is moderator only Update Discord if you don't see the commands and then DM a Administrator+ if you still cannot see it And... that's it! Yes, it's really that easy! Reviewing Bots Our bot list rules and requirements can be found here . Please read through them before reviewing bots. Whoever first adds the bot to this server can claim and check that bot. If you need to unclaim however, anyone may check it Where possible, test at least 70-100% of all bot commands randomly ( it would be preferable to test all of them but this is time consuming and we want to deal with our queue as well... ). Remember, case-by-case basis means use your own judgement and ask other staff members if unsure Some things that should be checked for. Note that all of the below is changeable on a case by case basis : Admin Commands (antinuke is a special case and has an exemption here) Admin-locked bots (antinuke is a special case and has an examption here) NSFW commands with proper channel gating Does the bot follow Discord ToS? Is the bot offline? If so, take a screenshot of the bot being offline. Once you have taken a screenshot, post the media link in the reason for denial Quality of the bot. Does it provide any unique and interesting features? What is its use case? The staff verification code is not SHA1 of Frostpaw/[user id]. Is it a copy/fork of another bot? Is the bot well-known and known to be high-quality? Is the bots owner correct (validate using other bot lists or Head Admins+ if needed), report violations to a Admin+ ASAP Quality of bot descriptions and long description Remember. Approve and deny bots without bias. Just because you like/dislike the owner does NOT mean you approve/deny their bots! Info Head Admins+ may approve known large bots without fully testing them if they are KNOWN to be high quality and have been widely used by them. This is in place to reduce our queue size allowing smaller bots to be tested more quickly and with better feedback If a bot is in need of verification, it may also be tested on its support server. This also goes for regular bots as well. Bots in other languages Do not deny bots for using other languages. These are officially supported. Instead, do one of the following: Use Google Translate: https://translate.google.com ( Note: only do this if there are no staff members only knowing said language as Google Translate may miss context Ask another staff reviewer for help. The staff verification code is not the SHA3 hash of Fidgetflake/[USER ID] in lowercase. Unclaim the bot and ping the Staff role asking someone to translate the bot ( the Staff role, not everyone ) Prefix Changes Do not deny bots for not supporting custom prefixes. This is a suggestion. Instead mute the bot on the support server after approval and adding to the main server. Same goes with any other suggestions in the rules Partnerships All partnerships are to be decided by FL Kremlin or Overseers. If you are not in FL Kremlin, DM any partnership requests to a Head Admin+. The same goes with staff applications Getting Help Feel DM any staff member if you need help with something. We are here to help you. Don't be rude and always strive to be respectful. Ban Appeals We use our Ban Appeals Server to handle Ban Appeals. This approach was chosen to ensure that ban appeals are personalised for users. Not everyone that gets banned may want to appeal (some just want the ban reason) and not everyone that gets banned falls into the same category as someone else. As staff, you are expected to deal with ban appeals and turn to a higher up when required. Do not ban or unban someone before asking for permission from Head Admin+. Warn or kick instead Review Process Quick Start Run /claim to claim the bot. Be sure to unclaim it with /unclaim if you are not reviewing it anymore Test the bot as per Reviewing Bots Use /approve and /deny accordingly Lynx Once you get accepted into FL Kremlin and have a role of Admin/Head Admin+, you can request access to Lynx Lynx is our admin panel giving you complete control of the database. Access is granted manually and will be monitored. You will be removed for abuse. The verification code is the SHA3-224 of Shadowsight/BristleXRoot/[USER ID] Lynx can/is slightly buggy at times. Report these bugs to Rootspring#6701 please. Some ground rules with Lynx: Do not use Lynx for normal moderation/bot review. Use the admin bot instead Use Lynx as little as possible. Ties with point 1 above When in doubt, ask. Do not change enums/delete rows you think are erroneous, it probably is intentionally like that Do not, absolutely do not share login credentials or access to Lynx with others without the explicit permission of Rootspring#6701 . This also includes storing access credentials on notes etc. FL Kremlin Lastly, FL Kremlin. We've had many outsiders coming in and we are OK with this as it allows for transparency. This is why no highly sensitive information should be shared on FL Kremlin Group Chat The word of Rootspring#6701 is final although debates are always recommended if you disagree with something.

This has been rewritten in golang to allow for better performance and reliability as well as new features that could not be implemented performantly in python What are Websockets? Please read this nice MDN doc on WebSockets first before attempting this from scratch. We have example libraries below in case you just want to get it done quickly! Receiving Responses Large responses are seperated using ASCII Code 31 This is \\x1f in python. Some example code on how to recieve responses from websocket is below: for m in event . split ( \" \\x1f \" ): for e in m . split ( \" \\x1f \" ): if e == \"\" : continue e_json = json . loads ( e ) if e_json . get ( \"m\" ): e_type = e_json [ \"m\" ] . get ( \"e\" ) ... elif e_json . get ( \"control\" ): ... await self . hooks [ \"default\" ]( e_json ) Payloads Payloads sent by the websocket server are either events or control payloads. The format for sending data from the client to the websocket is still being worked on and is not used in any case. Below is the format for a control payload: Key Description Type chan The redis channel of the object String? code The control payload name. This can be used to check for an identity etc. String detail Human friendly information describing the control payload for debugging. May be used in future for non-debugging purposes String ts The timestamp in seconds for the event Integer/Float requests_remaining The amount of requests remaining before you are ratelimited. Is always -1 in initial identity for now Integer control Always set to true in a control payload Boolean All other payloads sent to you by websocket will be a event as of right now. This may change in the future. Identity When you recieve a identity control payload, you should respond with the following format (or as given in the detail key) Key Description Type id Bot/Server ID Snowflake token API Token String send_all Whether or not to send all prior events. This may cause disconnects/instability, more memory usage and ratelimits on large bots Boolean send_none Whether or not to send events after sending prior events if send_all is set Boolean bot Set this to true for a bot, otherwise this will default to a guild Boolean After a successful identity, you will now have a established websocket connection.
